#TASK1:
1]task1-variable:studied the rule of variable declarion in python.
2]task1-operators:studied various operator in python namely Arithmatic,Assignment,logical,identity,comparison,Bitwise,membership etc.
3]task1-list:studied the data type list and its method like append remove insert pop sort count accessing,copy reverse and its properties.
4]task1-tuples:studied how to declare tuple its method like count index etc.
5]task1-set:set declaration,properties like mutable,ordered,etc
6]task1-dictionary:declaratin of dict,methods like copy index pop and use of for loop for accessing
7]task1-string:declaration and use of functions like upper lower split strip replace etc.
8]task1-number:substeps like int float and complex,its method

#TASK2:
1]task2 if stmt:-use of if statement to check a single condition in various example like to check whether a number is positive negative,even odd etc.
2]task2 if else stmt:-used to check two condition in example like checking a number is even or odd,greater or smaller,negative or positive and other similar examples.
3]task2 if elif else:-to test multiple condition at a time if the above condition false then the next one to it is tested.studied examples like to ckeck whether number is positive negative or zero and other ssimilar examples.
4]task2 for loop:used for accessing the elements in a list tuple and its method.
5]task2 while loop:use of while loop to print a sequence of number print

#Task3:
In task3 we studied the break,pass,continue statement also we studies user defined functions like statistical(mean,median,mode,etc.)and logical(odd,even,grades)#break-functionality when break is encounted insided loop,the loop stops its execution and control is transferred to the statement immediately following the loop.use case:it is useful when you want to exist a loop as soon as certain condition is met,avoiden unnecessary iterations.#continue functionality:when continue is encounted, the current iteration is terminated,and the loop processed with the next iteration.use case:it is useful when you want to skip over some parts of the loop but continue with the nextiterations for instance,you might want to skip over even numbers or any specific condition  within a loop.#pass functionality:The pass statement does nothing and is used as placeholder.use case it is useful when statement is synthetically required,but you do not want any action to be taken commonly used during development as placeholder for future code,in empty function or class definition ,or within condional statement where you plan to add code later.#statistical user defined function-statistical functions are essential for data analysis and help summarizes and understand the data's property .mean is used to calculate average of list of numbers .median is used to find the middle value of alist numbers .mode is used to find the most frequently occuring values in list numbers variance is used to measures spread of numbers in a list from the mean. standard deviation is used to measure the amount of variation or dispersion of set values.percentile is used to determine the value below which a given percentage of observations fall range is used to calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a list interquartile Range(IQR) is used to measure middle 50% of the data.covariance is used to measure how to variable change together.correlation coefficient used to measure the strenth and direction of the relationship between two variable.#logical user defined: 
is even purpose:check if a number is even.#is odd purpose check if no. is odd.#check palindrome purpose etc.
